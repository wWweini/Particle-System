# Particle-System
A particle system is a computational technique used to model the behavior of numerous small entities, or "particles," which follow identical rules. Individually, each particle is simple, but collectively, they produce intricate and visually striking effects. For example, in the provided animation, particles mimic water droplets being sprayed, where each droplet represents a single particle.

These systems are widely employed across computer graphics, including video games, films, app interfaces, and visual effects. They replicate natural phenomena like rain, fire, smoke, fog, and organic movement (e.g., flocks of birds or insect swarms). A key advantage of particle systems is their efficiencyâ€”minimal code can generate complex, dynamic visuals, making them a powerful tool for creating immersive environments and effects.
